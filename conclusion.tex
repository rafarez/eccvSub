\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
In this paper, we address the problem of large scale image retrieval with global image representation. 
We presented a simples idea, the kernelized square-loss exemplar machine, and yet an elegant implementation. 
As a result, we obtain significant improvement over the image representations we tested, outperform similar encoders and near state of the art performances.
As future work, we must test our method on state of the art representations and see how it impacts their results.
The use of other kernel functions is also encouraged. The polynomial outperforms the Gaussian kernel, even though the Hilbert space obtained from the Gaussian kernel has infinite dimensions \emph{\color{red} fact check}. 
The spatial pyramid kernel can be used to improve representations based on local descriptors
